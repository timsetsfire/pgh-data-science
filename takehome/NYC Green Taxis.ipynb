    "The goal of the Boro Taxi program is to improve access to street-hail transportation throughout the five boroughs – especially for persons with disabilities and people who live or spend time in areas of New York City historically underserved by the yellow taxi industry.  These Boro Taxis are referred as Green Taxis\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Boro Taxi drivers](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/shl_passenger.shtml) can pick up passengers from the street in northern Manhattan (north of West 110th street and East 96th street), the Bronx, Queens (excluding the airports), Brooklyn and Staten Island and they may drop you off anywhere. Each vehicle is associated with a local car service that has been affiliated with the Boro Taxi program and can still participate in pre-arranged trips. Boro Taxi drivers can be dispatched to pick you up in northern Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island and at the airports, but may not pick up any trips – pre-arranged or street hail – in the Manhattan exclusionary zone.\"\n",

    "> The rules for the owners of the new 'Boro Taxis,' as the green ones are dubbed, are simple: they are not allowed to pick up street hails on the home turf, as it were, of the yellow taxi – Manhattan below 110th St. on the West Side, and below 96th St. on the East Side, or at either LaGuardia or JFK airports. Otherwise, they can ply the streets anywhere else in the city, and can also be on call through a dispatcher.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the rules governing Green Taxi fares, Green Taxis can only pick up fares from JFK or Laguardia which have been prearranged, therefore, I would imagine there will be a very limited number of fare originating from either NYC Area Airport.  \n",
    "\n",
    "JFK is a very easy ask, provided we trust the `RateCodeID` in the dataset.  Taxis trips to JFK are flatrate, and are logged accordingly.  So we could get an easy count of Fares originated or ended at JFK.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Laguardia trips aren't so easy and will require significantly more work!  Laguardia trips are regular rate fares so there is no marker in the record that will make this count as easy as the JFK ask.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The markers in the data set are subject to human input.  So how good are they?\n",
    "2.  Latitude and Longitude of drop off and pick up are available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provided the counts, the plan is as follows: Create a bounding box for JFK and Laguardia.  This is done by going to google maps and dropping pins around both airports and recording the latitude and longitude, then using [shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), we iterate through points and determine whether or not the pickup location and/or the dropoff location is contained in each airports bounding box.  It may be more apprporiate to convert the latitudes and longitudes to [Universal Traverse Mercator coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system), but I think the results from my approach are good enough.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of doing JFK as well is to compare my construction against the `RateCodeID` in the dataset.  I am assuming that the geo locations are accurate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I only thought of using the bounding boxes after I figured out that using the geocode from google wasn't going to work out so great.  The original plan was to use the RateCodeID, and the distances between the dropoff geo locale and JFK geolocale (as determined from google maps.  I was disregarding pickup locations since there should be a very small number of pickup at JFK.  I would then choose the median distance as the radius of a circle, which had center at JFK geo locale, then I would go through and see which points fell in the circle, but it just was not working out.
